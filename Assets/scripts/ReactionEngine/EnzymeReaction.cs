  \brief This class manage enzyme reactions
  \details

Manage enzymatic reactions.
This class manages enzymatic reactions that convert specific molecules, called substrates (S)
into different ones, called products (P.). An enzyme (E) is a highly selective catalyst for a defined substrate,
and accelerates both the rate and specificity of metabolic reactions. The enzyme activity can be affected by other
 molecules called activators (increased activity) or inhibitors (decreased activity).

In this simulation we have used a model that can describe enzymes kinetics (Michaelis-Menten)
 as well as common models of enzyme inhibition and activation by other molecules (different from the substrate).
The following scheme is a generalized model of inhibition that can describe competitive,
 uncompetitive, mixed and non-competitive inhibition, as well as heterotropic activation.
